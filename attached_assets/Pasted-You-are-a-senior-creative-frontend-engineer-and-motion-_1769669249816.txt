You are a senior creative frontend engineer and motion designer.

Your task is to design and build a luxury, high-end website inspired by the attached reference video’s animations, transitions, pacing, and motion language — but NOT copy content or branding.

Brand context:
The brand sells premium lab-grown diamonds.
The brand personality is: elegant, futuristic, minimal, ethical luxury, science-meets-art.

Core objectives:
- Replicate the same level of smoothness, scroll-based storytelling, and cinematic motion as the reference video
- Use Lenis for ultra-smooth scrolling
- Use Spline for interactive 3D diamond scenes
- Maintain a clean, white/black/soft-neutral luxury palette with subtle shimmer effects
- Typography should feel premium (serif + modern sans-serif pairing)

Tech stack:
- Next.js or React (App Router preferred)
- Tailwind CSS
- Lenis for smooth scrolling
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger for animations
- Spline embeds for 3D diamonds
- Framer Motion for micro-interactions
- AI image generation integration (mock API acceptable)

Website structure:

1. Hero Section
- Full viewport cinematic hero
- Slow parallax movement on scroll
- Floating lab-grown diamond rendered in Spline
- Subtle light refraction animation
- Headline example:
  “Pure Brilliance. Engineered by Science.”
- Scroll hint animation (minimal)

2. Scroll-Driven Story Section
- As the user scrolls, content fades/slides in smoothly
- Explain:
  • What lab-grown diamonds are
  • Ethical sourcing
  • Same brilliance, zero compromise
- Use pinned sections and horizontal motion like the reference video

3. Interactive 3D Diamond Section
- Embedded Spline scene
- User can rotate diamond slightly on mouse move
- Light reacts to cursor movement
- Background stays minimal

4. AI-Generated Diamond Visuals Section
- Integrate an AI image generation workflow:
  • Generate hyper-realistic lab-grown diamond images
  • Clean studio lighting
  • Transparent or white background
- Use a placeholder/mock API if real AI API keys are unavailable
- Images should lazy-load with fade-in animation

5. Craftsmanship / Science Section
- Scroll-triggered diagrams or text reveals
- Clean grid layout
- Motion should feel slow, intentional, and premium

6. Product / Collection Preview
- Minimal cards
- Hover animations: soft scale + shadow + glow
- No e-commerce checkout required

7. Footer
- Calm, slow fade-in
- Brand philosophy text
- Minimal links

Animation & Motion Guidelines:
- No harsh or fast animations
- Everything should feel smooth, floaty, and expensive
- Use easing curves similar to cinematic websites
- Prefer opacity, translateY, scale, and blur transitions
- Avoid overusing effects

Performance:
- Optimize for 60fps
- Lazy load Spline scenes and AI images
- Ensure smooth scrolling does not block interactions

Deliverables:
- Full working website code
- Modular components
- Clean folder structure
- Clear comments explaining animation logic
- Placeholder assets where necessary

Important:
Do NOT copy the reference video directly.
Match the animation style, motion pacing, and storytelling quality only.
Make it feel original, premium, and suitable for a lab-grown diamond luxury brand.
