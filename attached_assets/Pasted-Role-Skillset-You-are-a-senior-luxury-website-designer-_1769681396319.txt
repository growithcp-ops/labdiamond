Role & Skillset
You are a senior luxury website designer, motion graphics expert, and front-end engineer experienced in premium jewelry brands.

1️⃣ THEME & VISUAL STYLE

Use this theme consistently across the site:

Luxury, futuristic, minimal

Dark charcoal / near-black background

Soft platinum whites, subtle silver accents

No bright colors, no flashy effects

Clean grid, large spacing, calm visual rhythm

Typography:

Elegant serif for headings

Modern sans-serif for body text

Large headlines, slow reveals

2️⃣ MOTION LANGUAGE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Implement slow, cinematic, scroll-driven motion:

Ease-in-out only (no bounce, no elastic)

Text appears first, visuals after

Subtle fades, gentle slides, slight scaling

Everything should feel premium and calm

Use:

GSAP + ScrollTrigger (preferred)

Or Framer Motion

3️⃣ MID SECTION: CARBON → CRYSTAL TRANSFORMATION

Create a scroll-based transformation section:

Behavior:

Start with a carbon-like dark textured image

As user scrolls:

Carbon slowly fades, cracks, or dissolves

Transforms into a clear lab-grown diamond

Light reflections increase gradually

Motion rules:

Smooth cross-fade + scale-up

Diamond appears sharper and brighter as scroll progresses

Section should feel magical but subtle

4️⃣ COLLECTION SECTION (CORE FEATURE)

Use 5 different lab-grown diamond images.

Initial Layout:

One main image appears in the center first

Then:

Two images on the right fade in

Two images on the left fade in

Overall layout forms a V-shape

Motion Sequence:

Center image fades + scales in

Right two images fade in with slight upward offset

Left two images fade in with slight upward offset

5️⃣ HORIZONTAL SCROLL BEHAVIOR

Images are scrollable horizontally

Horizontal scroll should feel smooth and premium

Maintain V-shape alignment while scrolling

6️⃣ INTERACTION LOGIC (IMPORTANT)
Click Behavior:

Step 1:
Clicking any diamond image →

It expands smoothly into a full-screen hero page

Dark background, large centered diamond

Step 2:
Clicking again on the hero page →

Reveals product details

Specs, description, ethical lab-grown messaging

Step 3:
Clicking Next button →

Slides horizontally to the next diamond product

Smooth slide transition (no page reload)

7️⃣ AI-GENERATED DIAMOND IMAGES

Do NOT use stock images.

Generate diamond visuals using prompt-based AI:

Example prompt:
“Ultra-realistic lab-grown diamond, luxury jewelry photography, studio lighting, black background, high clarity, premium reflections”

Use generated images for:

Carbon → crystal section

Collection images

Hero product views

Include soft loading animations while images generate.

8️⃣ TECH STACK & CODE QUALITY

React

Tailwind CSS

GSAP + ScrollTrigger

Modular components

Clean, readable, production-ready code

Performance:

Lazy loading

Optimized animations

60fps target

9️⃣ FINAL EXPECTATION

The website should feel like:
A 2026 luxury lab-grown diamond brand

Elegant. Calm. Ethical. High-end.

Important:
Do not redesign creatively.
Follow the described animation sequence and interaction flow exactly.
